\chapter{Analytical mechanics of particle systems}

Established approaches of analytical mechanics commonly rely on the parameterization of the system in terms of \textit{minimal} generalized coordinates $\genCoord$ and their derivatives $\genCoordd$.
In this section we like to review these approaches for redundant configuration coordinates $\sysCoord(t) \in \configSpace$ and nonholonomic velocity coordinates $\sysVel(t)\in\RealNum^\dimConfigSpace$ as introduced in the previous section.
The formulations might become more cumbersome, but with some examples we like to show that the resulting equations of motions might actually be less cumbersome and reflect the geometry of the system better.
